# User Guide

Welcome to **Code Documentation Navigator** 🎉  
This guide walks you through how to use the application to analyze
and understand source code using AI.

No prior setup or technical knowledge is required to get started.

---

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. Open the Code Documentation Navigator website
2. You will see a code input area and a question box
3. Everything works directly in your browser

---

## ✍️ Step 1: Paste Your Code

- Paste any code snippet into the **Code Editor**
- Supported languages include:
  - Python
  - Java
  - C / C++
  - JavaScript / TypeScript
  - Go
  - Rust

You can paste:
- Functions
- Classes
- Full scripts
- Code snippets

---

## ❓ Step 2: Ask a Question (Optional)

In the question input box, you can ask:
- What the code does
- How it works
- Why it was written this way
- Any specific behavior you want explained

### Example Questions
- *“Explain this code step by step”*
- *“What is the purpose of this function?”*
- *“Are there any edge cases?”*

If no question is provided, the system will generate a general explanation.

---

## 🌐 Step 3: Select Programming Language

Choose the programming language of your code from the dropdown menu.

This helps the AI:
- Understand syntax correctly
- Use language-specific terminology
- Provide more accurate explanations

---

## ⚡ Step 4: (Optional) Enable Context Optimization

For very large code inputs, you can enable **Smart Context Optimization**.

### When to use it
- Large files
- Long scripts
- Multiple functions or classes

### What it does
- Compresses code before AI analysis
- Preserves logic and structure
- Improves performance and response time

This option is **off by default**.

---

## ▶️ Step 5: Analyze the Code

Click the **Analyze Code** button.

While processing:
- The button is temporarily disabled
- A loading message is displayed

Once complete, the explanation appears in the output section.

---

## 📄 Understanding the Output

The explanation may include:
- A high-level overview
- Step-by-step breakdown
- Headings for clarity
- Examples or edge case discussion (when relevant)

The format adapts to your question automatically.

---

## 📱 Mobile & Responsive Usage

- The application works on mobile devices
- Layout adjusts for smaller screens
- Text and content remain readable

For best experience with large code, desktop usage is recommended.

---

## 🚫 Common Usage Tips

- Ensure code is pasted correctly
- Select the correct programming language
- Enable compression only for long inputs
- Avoid refreshing while analysis is in progress

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Ask specific questions for better results
- Analyze one logical unit of code at a time
- Use compression for performance, not small snippets
